  <p>Knowledge is what advances humanity. It is a valuable resource which can be multiplied with reasonable effort.
Shared knowledge can empower the unprivileged, and contribute to a better world in many other ways.
If possible, knowledge should be <a href="http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/">open</a>.</p>
<p>This applies to software as well. I prefer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open-source software</a> whenever there is a suitable option.</p>
<p>Data collected by public institutions (excluding personal information) should be <a href="http://okfn.org/opendata/">open data</a>. Publishing data funded by taxpayers benefits the general public as well as local industry.
A great example of open geographical data is <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap</a>. The level of detail in remote regions still surprises me.</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge is often hidden behind publishers' paywalls for the non-academic public or less resourceful research institutions.
The <a href="http://open-access.net/de_en/open_access_in_individual_disciplines/physics/">Open Access</a> movement is addressing that issue. Luckily, many research institutions and research funding entitys have adopted an open access policy.</p>
<p>Current copyright law, intended to protect the interests of artists, but mostly benefitting big players in the media industry, turns out to restrain creativity.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement">free culture movement</a> provides licenses to work around traditional copyright while protecting the artist's interests.
These licenses can be applied to writing, music, images, and more.</p>
