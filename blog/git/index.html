  <p>While writing, it is usually neccessary to organize multiple revisions of the files.
Manual organization is quite inefficient, there are specialized tools that have features like reverting changes, merging changes made by several people,
showing differences between revisions and many more.</p>
<p>The most popular tool for revision control is <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>. It works with any text-based files: text, source code, spreadsheet data, and others.
The git website offers great documentation and tutorials.</p>
<p>If you need to share your files with others or want to make them available on a server to access them from several devices, there are many options.
A few are sketched here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most popular git hosting provider is <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. Many open source projects can be found here, and it can also be used for private files.</li>
<li>An open-source alternative with similar feature set is <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, available as hosted or self-hosted variants.</li>
<li>You can host your own server running with an authorization solution like <a href="http://gitolite.com/gitolite/overview.html">gitolite</a>.</li>
<li>If you work with a team and want a review process, you can use <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a> for access control as well.</li>
</ul>
