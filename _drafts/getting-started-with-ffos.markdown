The [Firefox Marketplace Developer Hub](https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/) has everything you need to get started.

Developing an app works without a phone: Install the [Firefox OS Simulator](https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/docs/firefox_os_simulator) addon for Firefox on your desktop computer.
Create a folder containing two files: `index.html` and `manifest.webapp`. Start the simulator (Tools, Web Developer, Firefox OS Simulator) and add your directory. At this point you can already run your first app.

Firefox OS Apps are pure HTML5. To make your app look native, use the [UX building blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks).
